Using a spatially explicit, temporally dynamic, mechanistic, individual-based simulator of a model alien invader, the cane toad (Rhinella marina), we simulated colonisation scenarios to investigate how (1) the number of founding individuals, (2) the number of dispersal events, (3) landscape’s spatial composition and configuration of habitats (“spatially heterogenous landscapes”), and (4) timing of arrival with regards to dynamic environmental conditions (“dynamic environmental conditions”) influence the establishment success of small founding populations. We analysed the dynamic effects of these predictors on establishment success using running-window logistic regression models.
